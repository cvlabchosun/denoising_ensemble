# Paper: Denoising single images by feature ensemble revisited
# Architecture: 
We have provided our architecture called Network.py.
# Experimental results: 
The three different .zip folders contain results of our method for the fixed AWGN = 50 on three different dataset i.e. BSD68, Kodak24, and Urban100. The visitors can calculate the PSNR and SSIM using psnr_ssim.ipynb.
